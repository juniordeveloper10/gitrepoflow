What year did Chainlink start?
History. Chainlink was created in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, 
who co-authored a white paper introducing the Chainlink protocol and network
 with Cornell University professor Ari Juels the same year.
 Chainlink acts as a "bridge" between a blockchain and off-chain environments.
